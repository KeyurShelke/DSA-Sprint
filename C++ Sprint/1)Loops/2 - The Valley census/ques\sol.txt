Write a C++ program that:
1. Reads an integer N (number of residents) from standard input. 2. Reads N space-separated integers (the energy levels).
3. Prints four lines as follows:
Input
- First line: "Even: X", where X is the count of even numbers.
- Second line: "Odd: X", where X is the count of odd numbers.
- Third line: "Positive: X", where X is the count of positive numbers (strictly greater than zero).
- Fourth line: "Negative: X", where X is the count of negative numbers (strictly less than zero).
â€¢ The first line contains a single integer N - the number of values.
The second line contains N space-separated integers - the energy levels.
Output
Print four lines in the specified format:
Even: X
Odd: Y
Positive: Z
Negative: W
where X, Y, Z, and W are the respective counts.
Note: Print output in the exact format as shown, one category per line with no extra space or newline at the end.


** Solution **

ğŸ“Œ Input:
First line: Number of residents N

Second line: N space-separated integers representing their energy levels

ğŸ“Œ Logic:
Loop through each energy value:

evenCount: Increment if number % 2 == 0

oddCount: Increment if number % 2 != 0

positiveCount: Increment if number > 0

negativeCount: Increment if number < 0

Challenge
Write a C++ program that:
• Reads an integer N from standard input.
• Prints N rows, where the ith row contains the first i capital English letters (from 'A' onward), each row on a new line.
Input
A single integer N.
Output
Print N rows of the alphabet pattern, as described. Each row i should contain the capital letters from 'A' to the ith letter.
Note: Don't print any space or extra line at the end.
Example
Input
5
Output
A
AB
ABC
ABCD
ABCDE

 Explanation:
📥 Input:
One integer N → number of rows.

🧠 Logic:
Outer loop runs i from 1 to N (for each row).

Inner loop prints characters from 'A' to 'A' + i - 1:

For i = 1 → prints A

For i = 2 → prints AB

...

After each row, print a newline, except after the last row (to match the “no extra line” rule).

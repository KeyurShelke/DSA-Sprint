Challenge
Write a C++ program that:
1. Reads an integer N from standard input (the number of measurements).
2. Reads N space-separated integers, each representing the height of a mountain or valley.
3. Prints the maximum height on the first line and the minimum height on the second line.
Input
• The first line contains a single integer N — the number of measurements.
• The second line contains N space-separated integers, the heights (which may be negative, zero, or positive).
Output
Print two lines:
• First line: the maximum value among the heights
• Second line: the minimum value among the heights
Note: Print exactly as specified: one value per line for the maximum and minimum with
no extra space or newline at the end.


** Solution **

Reads N from input.

Reads N space-separated heights into a vector.

Initializes maxVal and minVal to the first height.

Loops through the rest to find:

maxVal: the largest height

minVal: the smallest height

Prints maxVal and minVal on separate lines, with no extra space or newline at the end, as required.

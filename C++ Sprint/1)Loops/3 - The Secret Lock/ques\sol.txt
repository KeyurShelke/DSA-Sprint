Challenge
Write a C++ program that:
1. Reads two integers, K and S, from standard input.
2. Counts and prints the number of valid integer triples (X, Y, Z) that satisfy the above conditions.
Input
A single line containing two integers, K and S.
Output
A single integer: the number of valid combinations with no extra space or newline at the end.
Example
Input
22
Output
6

** Solution **

🔍 Explanation:
🧠 Problem Breakdown:
You need to find how many combinations of 
(X,Y,Z)
(X,Y,Z) exist such that their sum is exactly S and all values are within range 0 to K.

🔁 Nested Loop Logic:
Loop through all possible values of X and Y from 0 to K.

Compute Z = S - X - Y.

Check if Z is in the range 0 to K.

If yes → valid combination → increment count.

⚠️ Output Format:
Print only the number (no extra space or newline at the end), as required.

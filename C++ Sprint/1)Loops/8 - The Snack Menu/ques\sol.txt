Problem Statement
Anirudh runs a popular snack stall in his neighborhood. He has a special menu for his regular customers:
1. Samosa
2. Kachori
3. Jalebi
4. Chai
Customers place their orders by entering the item number. Anirudh must create a program that will print the name of the item for each valid number entered, or say `Invalid choice` for any other number.
Challenge
Write a C++ program that:
• Reads an integer from standard input, representing the menu item code.
• Uses a switch-case statement to print the name of the snack. If the code does not match any snack, print `Invalid choice`.
Input
A single integer representing the menu item code.
Output
Print the name of the snack corresponding to the code. If the code is invalid, print `Invalid choice`.
Note: Don't print any extra space or newline at the end.

Explanation
📥 Input:
One integer code, which represents the item number ordered.

🔁 Logic:
Use a switch-case to match the item number:

1 → "Samosa"

2 → "Kachori"

3 → "Jalebi"

4 → "Chai"

If the number is not 1–4, the default case runs, printing "Invalid choice".

⚠️ Important Notes:
We use break to stop the switch from falling through.

There's no extra space or newline at the end, as required.

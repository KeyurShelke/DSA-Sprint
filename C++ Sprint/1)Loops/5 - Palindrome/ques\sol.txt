Problem Statement:
Write a program that takes a non-negative integer as input and determines whether it is a palindrome. A number is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.
You must use a while loop to reverse the number do not convert the number to a string.
Input:
A single non-negative integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 1,000,000,000)
Output:
Print Yes if the number is a palindrome.
Otherwise, print No.
Sample Input
121
Sample Output
Yes

** Solution **

Step-by-step logic:
Step	n	    digit = n % 10	  reversed = reversed * 10 + digit	 New n = n / 10
1	    121	    1	              0 * 10 + 1 = 1	                 12
2	    12	    2	              1 * 10 + 2 = 12	                 1
3	    1	    1	              12 * 10 + 1 = 121	                 0

Now reversed = 121 and original = 121

Since they’re equal → ✅ Palindrome → Output: Yes

Problem Statement:
Write a program that takes a non-negative integer as input and calculates the sum of its digits using a while loop.
Input:
A single non-negative integer n (0 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 1,000,000,000)
Output:
â€”
A single integer - the sum of the digits of n.
Example:
Input:
12345
Output: 15
Explanation:
The digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Their sum is 1+ 2+ 3+ 4+ 5 = 15.
Additional Notes:
â€¢ You should use a while loop to extract and sum the digits. â€¢ Do not use built-in functions like sum() on strings or arrays.

** Solution **

ðŸ”¢ Step-by-step:
Letâ€™s say the input is 12345.

Step	n	     digit = n % 10	    sum	    n = n / 10
1	    12345	 5	                5	    1234
2	    1234	 4	                9	    123
3	    123	     3	                12	    12
4	    12	     2	                14	    1
5	    1	     1	                15	    0

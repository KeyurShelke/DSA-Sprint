Challenge
Write a C++ program that:
• Reads an integer n (the number of password attempts) from standard input.
• Reads n space-separated integers (the password attempts).
•
Prints Access Granted the moment 2025 is found among the inputs, and stops checking further passwords.
If 2025 is never present, prints Access Denied.
Note: Solve the problem using Do-While loop.
Input
First line: a single integer n - the number of password attempts.
Second line: n space-separated integers.
Output
A single line:
Access Granted if 2025 appeared as any of the password attempts (print only once, for the first match).
Otherwise, print Access Denied.
Note: Don't print any extra space or newline at the end.
Example 1
Input
5
1111 2023 9999 123 2025
Output
Access Granted




** Solution **

Step-by-step:
cin >> n;

Read the number of password attempts.

do { ... } while (count < n);

We use a do-while to ensure the loop runs at least once, and keeps running until all n attempts are processed.

cin >> attempt;

Read one password attempt.

if (attempt == 2025)

If the attempt is 2025, we set granted = true and break the loop immediately. No further attempts are checked.

After the loop

If granted is true → print Access Granted

Otherwise → print Access Denied

Alex is expanding their knowledge of arrays and wants to understand how to classify numbers. After
learning about even and odd numbers, Alex decides to write a program that counts how many even and odd numbers are present in a list entered by the user. Alex also wants the program to work for any number of elements the user chooses. Your task is to help Alex implement this.
Instructions:
1. Take the size of the array, N, as input.
2. Accept N space-separated integers as elements of the array.
3. Count how many of those numbers are even and how many are odd.
4. Print the counts.
Input Format:
An integer N
N space-separated integers
Output Format:
evenCount
Sample Input:
6
<space> oddCount
4 7 2 9 1 8
Sample Output:
33
Note: Do not print any additional text or newline or space after the output.

ðŸ“Œ Explanation:
evenCount: Increments when num % 2 == 0

oddCount: Increments otherwise

Final output is exactly evenCount followed by oddCount (like 33) without space or newline.
